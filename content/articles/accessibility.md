title: Why should you make your website accessible if you are not disabled (or mother told you so)
description: многое сказано про доступность в интернете, но чаще всего это морализаторство

The reasonable question for business owner is "why should I spend resources on implementing accessibility". Really, in most cases people who experience disabilities are not the key auditory of product (except cases they are). So the short answer is "you don't have to". 

Of course this conclusion is superficially.

## Who cares?

Business is not about _equality and diversity_, it's about **money**. May be your employer pays you for being a cool guy – mine does not. So it might be a good idea to explain how adopting accessibility in your project could be beneficial today.

It should be the goal of society to make the accessible web profitable for business, and then the laws of capitalism will take over. 

## Benefits

### SEO

### Reputation

### For developers

In most cases problems of accessibility are not related to the lack of some specific ARIA-attribute. 
Acceptable for assistive technologies markup can be achieved by proper use of all the variety of HTML5 elements, 
that are not only `<div>` and `<span>`.

Structuring your page during development also structures data in your head and clarifies the goal. 
## Conclusion

Most likely, the inability to see some sites is a blessing, not a curse.
Скорее всего, неспособность видеть некоторые сайты – благословение, никак не проклятие.
